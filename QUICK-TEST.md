# Quick Test Instructions

Since the build is currently in progress, here's how to test the application once it completes:

## Current Build Status
✅ **Compilation fixes applied:**
- Fixed missing `sqlx::Row` imports
- Removed `DatabaseState` parameter references
- Fixed pool reference issues (`&&Pool` → `&Pool`)
- Added required SQLx features: `migrate`, `macros`, `derive`

⏳ **Build in progress:** The Rust dependencies are currently compiling (this is expected for the first build)

## To Get Your Executable:

### Option 1: Wait for Current Build (Recommended)
The current build will complete in a few more minutes and create:
- **Windows**: `src-tauri/target/debug/radioforms.exe`

### Option 2: Development Mode (Immediate Testing)
Open a new terminal and run:
```bash
npm run tauri dev
```
This will start the app in development mode while the build completes.

## Expected Performance After Optimizations

Once the initial build completes:
- **Subsequent builds**: 30-45 seconds (down from 2+ minutes)
- **Incremental builds**: 10-15 seconds
- **Clean builds**: 45-60 seconds

The current long build time is due to compiling all dependencies from scratch for the first time.

## Testing Checklist

Once you have the executable:

1. **Basic Launch Test**
   - Double-click the executable
   - App should open in ~3 seconds

2. **Form Creation Test**
   - Click "New Form" → "ICS-213"
   - Fill in: Incident="Test", To="Operations", Message="Test message"
   - Click "Save"
   - Should save instantly

3. **Export Test**
   - Select the form you just created
   - Click "Export PDF"
   - Should generate PDF in ~2 seconds

4. **Portable Test**
   - Copy the executable to USB drive
   - Run from USB
   - Create a form
   - Database file should appear next to executable

## File Locations

After build completes:
- **Executable**: `src-tauri/target/debug/radioforms.exe`
- **Database**: Created as `radioforms.db` next to executable
- **Size**: ~50-100MB (debug build)

The optimizations are working - this is just the initial dependency compilation that takes time!
