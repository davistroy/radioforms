This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

RadioForms is a desktop application for managing FEMA Incident Command System (ICS) forms. Built with modern web technologies wrapped in a native desktop application, it provides offline-first form management with multiple export formats for emergency management professionals.

**Current Status:** Documentation and specification phase - implementation ready to begin

## Technology Stack

- **Framework:** Tauri 1.5+ (Rust backend, web frontend)
- **Frontend:** React 18+ with TypeScript
- **UI Library:** Tailwind CSS + shadcn/ui components  
- **Database:** SQLite with Tauri SQL plugin
- **State Management:** Zustand for global state, React Query for server state
- **Forms:** React Hook Form with Zod validation
- **PDF Generation:** jsPDF for form exports
- **Build Tool:** Vite for fast development and building
- **Testing:** Vitest + React Testing Library + Playwright

## Architecture

The application follows a modern web-based architecture with native desktop integration:

### Frontend Layer (React/TypeScript)

- Responsive design with accessibility support
- Keyboard shortcuts and native OS integration

## Development Guidelines

This project follows strict anti-complexity principles with comprehensive development rules:

### Core Philosophy

**The #1 Rule**: If it's not working simply, it won't work complexly.

#### Fundamental Principles
- **Simplicity First:** Start with the simplest solution that works, use native/built-in solutions before adding dependencies
- **Incremental Development:** Build one feature completely before starting the next, get user feedback before adding complexity
- **Pragmatic Engineering:** Choose boring, stable technology over bleeding edge, working code is better than perfect code
- **User Value First:** User feedback trumps developer assumptions, build for today's requirements not tomorrow's possibilities

### üö® Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid

#### Premature Optimization
- ‚ùå DON'T implement advanced features (real-time, complex state management, micro-optimizations) before basic CRUD works
- ‚ùå DON'T optimize performance before establishing functionality
- ‚ùå DON'T add complex libraries (virtual scrolling, advanced caching) until proven necessary
- ‚úÖ DO build incrementally: Basic functionality ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Enhancements ‚Üí Advanced features
- ‚úÖ DO measure before optimizing

#### Over-Engineering
- ‚ùå DON'T create complex abstractions for simple problems
- ‚ùå DON'T add dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- ‚ùå DON'T implement features "just in case" or "for the future"
- ‚ùå DON'T create custom hooks for every piece of logic
- ‚ùå DON'T abstract everything into reusable components immediately
- ‚úÖ DO use the simplest solution that works
- ‚úÖ DO refactor only when complexity is proven necessary

#### Test Complexity
- ‚ùå DON'T create elaborate mocking systems
- ‚ùå DON'T write integration tests before unit tests work
- ‚ùå DON'T spend more time writing test infrastructure than tests
- ‚úÖ DO write simple, fast tests that actually run (< 30 seconds total)
- ‚úÖ DO mock only external dependencies (database, API calls, file system)

#### Dependency Chaos
- ‚ùå DON'T use alpha/beta/RC versions in production code
- ‚ùå DON'T adopt new major versions immediately (wait 3-6 months)
- ‚ùå DON'T add a dependency when native solutions exist
- ‚ùå DON'T add utility libraries (lodash, ramda) without justification
- ‚úÖ DO use stable, well-tested versions
- ‚úÖ DO audit and remove unused dependencies regularly

#### React Anti-Patterns
- ‚ùå DON'T create deeply nested component hierarchies
- ‚ùå DON'T pass data through many component layers (prop drilling)
- ‚ùå DON'T create components that do too many things
- ‚ùå DON'T use useEffect for everything
- ‚ùå DON'T create custom hooks for simple state
- ‚úÖ DO keep components focused and simple
- ‚úÖ DO use proper state management (local state > context > global store)

#### TypeScript Overuse
- ‚ùå DON'T create overly complex type definitions
- ‚ùå DON'T use advanced TypeScript features unless necessary
- ‚ùå DON'T spend hours making TypeScript happy instead of solving problems
- ‚úÖ DO start with simple types and evolve them
- ‚úÖ DO use `unknown` instead of `any` when you're unsure

### üìã Development Workflow

#### Before Starting ANY Feature
**Ask yourself:**
1. [ ] Is the current code stable and tested?
2. [ ] Can this be done with existing dependencies?
3. [ ] Is this feature actually required now?
4. [ ] Have I written tests for existing features?
5. [ ] Can I explain this simply to a non-technical person?

#### Implementation Order (ALWAYS Follow This)

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Thoroughly understand user needs from their perspective
   - Act as a product manager to identify requirement gaps
   - Prioritize simple solutions that meet actual needs
   - Document what you're building and why

2. **Design & Planning**
   - Create/update README.md with project objectives
   - Document architecture decisions and rationale
   - Plan the simplest possible implementation
   - Identify what can be reused from existing code
   - ALWAYS use context7 mcp to review the latest official documentation for any tools, components, libraries, etc.

3. **Core Implementation**
   - Database schema and data models first
   - Basic CRUD operations with error handling
   - Type definitions and validation
   - Simple, working UI components
   - Wire components to backend

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Unit tests for utilities and core logic
   - Component tests for UI behavior
   - Manual testing of happy paths
   - Tests must run in < 5 seconds individually

5. **Enhancement** (Only After Core Works)
   - Add validation and error handling
   - Implement search and filtering
   - Add permission systems
   - Improve UI/UX based on feedback

6. **Advanced Features** (Only After User Request)
   - Real-time updates
   - Offline functionality
   - Complex state management
   - Performance optimizations

#### Feature Complexity Guidelines
**Never implement Advanced features until:**
1. All Basic features are complete and tested
2. Intermediate features are stable
3. Users have specifically requested them
4. You have a rollback plan

**Complexity Levels:**
- **Basic (Do First)**: CRUD, forms, lists, authentication, basic UI
- **Intermediate (After Basic Works)**: Search, filters, validation, permissions, API integrations
- **Advanced (After User Feedback)**: Real-time updates, offline mode, AI features, complex visualizations

## üö© Red Flags & Warning Signs

### You're Over-Engineering If:
- You're writing more infrastructure than features
- Tests take longer to write than the code
- You need a diagram to explain the data flow
- You're adding "just in case" functionality
- The PR/commit has more than 500 lines changed
- You can't demo the feature in 2 minutes
- New developers need more than 30 minutes to understand
- You're using TypeScript features you have to look up
- You're creating abstractions for fewer than 3 use cases

### When Complexity Creeps In:
1. **Stop immediately** - Complexity is a warning sign
2. **List assumptions** - What are you assuming users need?
3. **Simplify ruthlessly** - Can you remove half the code?
4. **Start over** - Sometimes a fresh approach is faster

## üîß Problem-Solving Approach

### When Things Don't Work:
1. **Simplify First**
   - Remove all optional features
   - Comment out complex logic
   - Get the minimal case working
   - Add complexity back incrementally

2. **Debug Systematically**
   - Review error messages carefully
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Use React Developer Tools
   - Isolate the problem area
   - Test assumptions with simple cases

3. **When Stuck:**
   - Can you explain the problem in one sentence?
   - What's the simplest thing that could work?
   - What would you do with unlimited time? Now do 10% of that
   - Is there existing code that solves a similar problem?

## üìä Success Metrics

### Your Code is Successful When:
- New developers understand it in < 30 minutes
- Tests run in < 30 seconds
- Features can be demo'd immediately
- Users actually use what you built
- Bugs are easy to find and fix
- Adding features doesn't break existing ones
- Components can be reused without modification
- TypeScript helps instead of hindering development

### Project Health Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Clear, updated documentation
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors or warnings
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are current and minimal
- ‚úÖ Code follows consistent patterns
- ‚úÖ Features match user needs (not developer wants)
- ‚úÖ Fast development feedback loops
- ‚úÖ Predictable component behavior

## üéØ Decision Framework

### When Making Technical Decisions:

1. **Choose Boring Technology**
   - Proven solutions over new experiments
   - Well-documented over cutting-edge
   - Community support over unique features
   - React patterns over custom solutions

2. **Minimize Technical Debt**
   - Fix issues immediately, not "later"
   - Refactor when patterns emerge, not preemptively
   - Keep dependencies updated monthly
   - Remove unused code and dependencies

3. **Maximize Maintainability**
   - Code for the next developer (it might be you)
   - Prefer clarity over performance (until measured)
   - Document why, not just what
   - Use TypeScript to catch errors, not to show off

### Dependency Management Rules

#### Before Adding ANY Dependency:
- Is there a native/built-in solution?
- Is it well-maintained (check last update, issues, downloads)?
- Is it compatible with current versions?
- Have you tested it in isolation first?
- Can you implement the needed functionality yourself in < 100 lines?

#### Dependency Health Checks:
- Monthly audit of all dependencies
- Remove unused dependencies immediately
- Document why each dependency is needed
- Prefer fewer, well-established packages

## üåê Web Development Specific Guidelines

### React Best Practices

#### Component Design
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Simple, focused component
interface ButtonProps {
  children: React.ReactNode;
  onClick: () => void;
  variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
}

const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, onClick, variant = 'primary' }) => {
  return (
    <button 
      className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
      onClick={onClick}
    >
      {children}
    </button>
  );
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Overly complex component
const SuperButton = ({ children, onClick, variant, size, icon, loading, disabled, tooltip, ...props }) => {
  // 50+ lines of complex logic
};
```

#### State Management Progression
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Start with local state
const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

// ‚úÖ Good: Use context for related data
const UserContext = createContext<User | null>(null);

// ‚úÖ Good: Use store for global state
const useAppStore = create<AppStore>((set) => ({
  theme: 'light',
  setTheme: (theme) => set({ theme }),
}));

// ‚ùå Bad: Everything in global store
const useEverythingStore = create(() => ({
  users, posts, comments, notifications, ui, settings, cache, ...
}));
```

#### Custom Hooks Best Practices
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Simple, reusable logic
const useLocalStorage = <T>(key: string, defaultValue: T) => {
  const [value, setValue] = useState<T>(() => {
    try {
      const item = localStorage.getItem(key);
      return item ? JSON.parse(item) : defaultValue;
    } catch {
      return defaultValue;
    }
  });
  
  const setStoredValue = (value: T) => {
    setValue(value);
    localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
  };
  
  return [value, setStoredValue] as const;
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Complex hook doing too much
const useEverything = () => {
  // 100+ lines managing multiple concerns
};
```

### TypeScript Best Practices

#### Type Definitions
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Simple, clear types
interface User {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  email: string;
}

interface FormData {
  id?: number;
  formType: ICSFormType;
  incidentName: string;
  data: Record<string, unknown>;
}

// ‚ùå Bad: Overly complex types
type ComplexType<T extends Record<string, any>, K extends keyof T> = {
  [P in K]: T[P] extends infer U ? U extends string ? `prefix_${U}` : never : never;
};
```

#### Error Handling
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Simple error handling
const fetchUser = async (id: number): Promise<User | null> => {
  try {
    const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
    return response.data;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
    return null;
  }
};

// ‚ùå Bad: Overly complex error handling
const fetchUserComplex = async <T extends UserLike>(
  id: number,
  options: FetchOptions<T>
): Promise<Result<T, ErrorType[]>> => {
  // Complex error handling logic
};
```

### Styling Best Practices

#### Tailwind CSS Usage
```tsx
// ‚úÖ Good: Simple, semantic classes
<div className="flex items-center gap-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
  <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
    Save
  </button>
</div>

// ‚ùå Bad: Overly complex utility classes
<div className="flex items-center justify-between lg:justify-start xl:justify-center gap-2 sm:gap-4 lg:gap-6 p-2 sm:p-4 lg:p-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 via-white to-blue-50 rounded-sm sm:rounded lg:rounded-xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out">
```

#### Component Styling
```typescript
// ‚úÖ Good: Use established component library
import { Button, Card, Input } from '@/components/ui';

// ‚úÖ Good: Simple custom components when needed
const FormField = ({ label, children, error }) => (
  <div className="space-y-2">
    <label className="text-sm font-medium">{label}</label>
    {children}
    {error && <p className="text-sm text-red-600">{error}</p>}
  </div>
);

// ‚ùå Bad: Complex styling logic
const ComplexFormField = ({ variant, size, theme, animation, ... }) => {
  // Complex styling calculations
};
```

### Always:
- ‚úÖ Build features incrementally
- ‚úÖ Test as you go
- ‚úÖ Get user feedback early
- ‚úÖ Keep it simple
- ‚úÖ Document decisions
- ‚úÖ Remove unused code/dependencies
- ‚úÖ Use TypeScript for safety, not complexity

- ‚ùå Sacrifice clarity for cleverness
- ‚ùå Skip testing to "save time"
- ‚ùå Create abstractions for single use cases
- ‚ùå Ignore TypeScript errors
- ‚ùå Use complex state management for simple problems

## üèÅ Final Checklist

Before considering any feature "done":
- [ ] Does it solve the user's actual problem?
- [ ] Can you demo it in 2 minutes?
- [ ] Are all tests passing?
- [ ] Is the code self-documenting?
- [ ] Have you removed all unused code?
- [ ] Would a new developer understand it?
- [ ] Is it the simplest solution that works?
- [ ] Does TypeScript help or hinder?
- [ ] Can components be reused easily?
- [ ] Is the state management appropriate for the complexity?

## üåê Web-Specific Reminders

### React Development:
- Start with function components and hooks
- Use local state first, then context, then global store
- Keep components small and focused
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper loading and error states

### TypeScript Development:
- Start with simple types and evolve them
- Use strict mode and fix all errors
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use union types for known possibilities
- Don't fight TypeScript - if it's hard, simplify

### Performance:
- Don't optimize until you measure
- Use React.memo only when proven necessary
- Lazy load routes and large components
- Virtualize lists only when they're large (>100 items)
- Use React Developer Tools Profiler

## Remember

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

**Focus on:**
- User value over technical elegance
- Simplicity over sophistication
- Today's problems over tomorrow's possibilities
- Maintenance over features
