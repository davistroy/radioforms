# Emergency Hotfix Deployment Guide
*Rapid Response for Critical Issues During Active Incidents*

## 🚨 WHEN TO USE THIS GUIDE

**EMERGENCY HOTFIX CRITERIA:**
- RadioForms failure is blocking ACTIVE emergency incident operations
- Data loss has occurred during emergency response
- Critical export failures prevent command briefings
- Security vulnerability with immediate operational risk

**NOT FOR REGULAR BUGS:** Use normal development process for non-emergency issues.

## ⏱️ EMERGENCY RESPONSE TIMELINE

### **0-5 Minutes: Assessment and Immediate Response**
### **5-15 Minutes: Emergency Workaround**
### **15-75 Minutes: Hotfix Development**
### **75-90 Minutes: Emergency Deployment**
### **90+ Minutes: User Verification and Follow-up**

---

## 🚨 PHASE 1: IMMEDIATE RESPONSE (0-5 Minutes)

### Step 1.1: Verify Emergency Status (30 seconds)
```bash
# Quick verification checklist
- [ ] Incident currently active (not training or planning)
- [ ] Multiple users affected OR single user in critical role
- [ ] No immediate workaround available
- [ ] Issue prevents life safety operations
```

### Step 1.2: Contact Emergency User (1 minute)
```bash
# Immediate phone contact
- Call user directly (get phone from GitHub issue)
- Confirm: "Are you currently responding to an active emergency?"
- Confirm: "Is this preventing emergency operations right now?"
- If YES to both: Continue emergency process
- If NO to either: Use standard support process
```

### Step 1.3: Provide Immediate Guidance (3 minutes)
```bash
# Emergency alternatives (while we fix the issue)
1. "Switch to paper forms immediately - don't wait"
2. "Continue emergency operations - technology never stops response"
3. "Take photos of paper forms for later data entry"
4. "I'm working on a fix right now - will call back in 15 minutes"
```

### Step 1.4: Emergency Escalation (1 minute)
```bash
# Send emergency notification
- Create GitHub issue with [EMERGENCY] tag
- Send emergency email to senior developer
- Send emergency SMS to IT director
- Update issue with initial assessment
```

---

## 🔧 PHASE 2: EMERGENCY WORKAROUND (5-15 Minutes)

### Step 2.1: Rapid Problem Diagnosis (5 minutes)
```bash
# Quick diagnostic questions
1. "What exactly happened when you tried to use RadioForms?"
2. "What error message did you see?" (ask for photo)
3. "When did this start working / stop working?"
4. "Are you able to start the application at all?"
5. "What's your computer type and operating system?"
```

### Step 2.2: Standard Emergency Workarounds (5 minutes)
```bash
# Try these in order (30 seconds each)
1. Restart application: "Close RadioForms completely and restart"
2. Restart computer: "Restart your computer if you have 2 minutes"
3. Use different device: "Is there another computer/tablet available?"
4. USB deployment: "Do you have a USB drive? I can help deploy there"
5. Different user: "Can someone else try RadioForms on your device?"
```

### Step 2.3: Emergency Backup Solution (5 minutes)
```bash
# If no workaround works
1. "Continue with paper forms - I'm building a fix"
2. "Use camera/phone to document critical information"
3. "Radio essential information - don't wait for forms"
4. "I'll have a fix ready in 30-60 minutes"
```

## ⚡ PHASE 3: HOTFIX DEVELOPMENT (15-75 Minutes)

### Step 3.1: Development Environment Setup (5 minutes)
```bash
# Set up emergency development environment
cd /path/to/radioforms
git checkout main
git pull origin main

# Create emergency branch
git checkout -b hotfix/emergency-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)-$(issue_number)

# Verify build works
npm install
npm run type-check
npm run lint
```

### Step 3.2: Identify Root Cause (10 minutes)
```bash
# Systematic debugging approach
1. Reproduce issue locally (if possible)
2. Check recent changes (git log --oneline -10)
3. Review error logs and stack traces
4. Test with user's configuration/data
5. Identify minimal fix required
```

### Step 3.3: Implement Minimal Fix (30 minutes maximum)
```bash
# Emergency fix principles
- Fix ONLY the immediate problem
- Use simplest possible solution
- Don't refactor or improve other code
- Add minimal necessary error handling
- Document what was changed and why

# Example fix approach
1. Comment out problematic code temporarily
2. Add null checks for data safety
3. Use fallback behavior for edge cases
4. Bypass non-essential features if needed
```

### Step 3.4: Emergency Testing (15 minutes)
```bash
# Rapid testing checklist
- [ ] Application starts successfully
- [ ] Core functionality works (create, edit, save forms)
- [ ] Export functionality works
- [ ] No new errors introduced
- [ ] Works on clean system (if possible)

# Test commands
npm run build
npm run type-check
npm run lint
npm run test
```

### Step 3.5: Document Emergency Fix (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create clear commit message
git add .
git commit -m "EMERGENCY HOTFIX: [brief description]

Issue: [link to GitHub issue]
Problem: [what was broken]
Fix: [what was changed]
Testing: [how it was verified]
Scope: Emergency fix only - proper solution needed

Emergency deployment approved for active incident response."
```

## 🚀 PHASE 4: EMERGENCY DEPLOYMENT (75-90 Minutes)

### Step 4.1: Emergency Build Process (5 minutes)
```bash
# Build for user's platform
npm run tauri build

# Verify build completed successfully
ls -la src-tauri/target/release/
file src-tauri/target/release/radioforms*

# Test build on clean system if possible
./src-tauri/target/release/radioforms
```

### Step 4.2: Emergency Package Creation (5 minutes)
```bash
# Create emergency deployment package
mkdir emergency-hotfix-$(date +%Y%m%d-%H%M)
cp src-tauri/target/release/radioforms* emergency-hotfix-*/
cp EMERGENCY-INSTALL.md emergency-hotfix-*/

# Create installation instructions
cat > emergency-hotfix-*/EMERGENCY-INSTALL.md << 'EOF'
# EMERGENCY HOTFIX INSTALLATION

1. BACKUP YOUR DATA FIRST:
   - Copy your current radioforms.db file to a safe location
   
2. CLOSE RADIOFORMS:
   - Close the application completely
   
3. REPLACE EXECUTABLE:
   - Replace your current radioforms executable with this one
   
4. RESTART APPLICATION:
   - Start RadioForms normally
   
5. VERIFY FIX:
   - Test the specific issue that was reported
   
6. REPORT RESULTS:
   - Call [phone] or email [email] immediately with results

If anything goes wrong, restore your backup and call immediately.
EOF
```

### Step 4.3: Rapid Delivery (5 minutes)
```bash
# Multiple delivery methods (use fastest available)
1. Direct file transfer: Use secure file sharing service
2. GitHub release: Create emergency release tag
3. Email attachment: For small files only
4. USB deployment: If user has USB access
5. Remote access: Screen sharing for direct installation
```

---

## ✅ PHASE 5: VERIFICATION AND FOLLOW-UP (90+ Minutes)

### Step 5.1: User Verification (10 minutes)
```bash
# Verify fix with user
1. Call user immediately after delivery
2. Guide through installation if needed
3. Test specific issue that was reported
4. Verify all basic functionality still works
5. Confirm they can continue emergency operations
```

### Step 5.2: Emergency Documentation (10 minutes)
```bash
# Document the emergency response
1. Update GitHub issue with resolution
2. Document what was broken and how it was fixed
3. Note any temporary workarounds in the fix
4. Identify what proper long-term fix is needed
5. Estimate timeline for proper fix
```

### Step 5.3: Post-Emergency Actions (30 minutes)
```bash
# Follow-up actions
1. Create proper fix task for next release
2. Review why this emergency occurred
3. Update emergency procedures if needed
4. Notify all relevant stakeholders
5. Schedule post-incident review meeting
```

## ⚠️ EMERGENCY LIMITATIONS

### What Emergency Hotfixes CAN Do
- Fix critical bugs preventing application startup
- Bypass problematic features temporarily
- Add basic error handling for edge cases
- Replace corrupted files with backups
- Provide temporary workarounds

### What Emergency Hotfixes CANNOT Do
- Add new features during emergencies
- Fix complex architectural problems
- Resolve hardware compatibility issues
- Replace missing system dependencies
- Fix user training or procedure issues

### When to Recommend Alternatives
- Issue requires extensive development time (>2 hours)
- Fix requires changes to multiple system components
- Problem is hardware or environment related
- Issue needs user training rather than software fix
- Risk of introducing more serious problems
