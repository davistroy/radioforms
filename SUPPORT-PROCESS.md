# RadioForms Post-Deployment Support Process
*Emergency-First Support for Critical Response Software*

## üö® EMERGENCY SUPPORT PROTOCOL

### Critical Rule: Emergency Response Comes First
**If RadioForms fails during an active emergency incident:**
1. **Switch to paper forms immediately** - Don't lose time troubleshooting
2. **Continue emergency operations** - Technology never stops life safety
3. **Report issue when safe** - After emergency situation is stabilized
4. **Follow emergency escalation** - See Emergency Contact Protocol below

---

## üìû SUPPORT PRIORITY CLASSIFICATION

### üî¥ **CRITICAL (Emergency Response Time: 15 minutes)**
**During Active Emergency Incidents:**
- Application won't start during active incident response
- Data loss during emergency operations
- Form corruption preventing incident documentation
- Critical export failures preventing command briefings

**Response Requirements:**
- Immediate phone contact within 15 minutes
- Emergency escalation to senior developer/IT director
- Hotfix deployment within 2 hours if possible
- Emergency workaround provided immediately

### üü° **HIGH (Response Time: 4 hours)**
**Non-Emergency Operational Impact:**
- Application crashes during training
- Data corruption in non-emergency scenarios
- Export failures during routine operations
- Installation problems on new systems

**Response Requirements:**
- Initial response within 4 hours during business hours
- Solution or workaround within 24 hours
- Full resolution within 72 hours

### üü¢ **MEDIUM (Response Time: 2 business days)**
**Planned Improvements:**
- Feature requests from users
- Performance optimization needs
- Documentation updates
- Non-critical user interface improvements

**Response Requirements:**

## üõ†Ô∏è EMERGENCY HOTFIX PROCESS

### Emergency Hotfix Criteria
Deploy emergency hotfixes only for:
- Data loss or corruption during active incidents
- Application startup failures preventing emergency use
- Critical export failures blocking command operations
- Security vulnerabilities with immediate risk

### Emergency Hotfix Procedure

#### Step 1: Issue Assessment (5 minutes)
1. **Verify emergency status** - Confirm active incident involvement
2. **Assess impact scope** - Single user or widespread issue
3. **Check for immediate workaround** - Temporary solution available
4. **Escalate if needed** - Contact senior developer immediately

#### Step 2: Emergency Response (10 minutes)
1. **Implement immediate workaround** - Provide user with alternative
2. **Create emergency GitHub issue** - Use EMERGENCY template
3. **Notify emergency contact chain** - Alert all relevant personnel
4. **Begin hotfix development** - Start with simplest possible fix

#### Step 3: Hotfix Development (30-60 minutes)
1. **Create emergency branch** - `hotfix/emergency-YYYYMMDD-issue`
2. **Implement minimal fix** - Smallest change that resolves issue
3. **Test fix locally** - Verify fix works, doesn't break other functions
4. **Document fix clearly** - What was broken, what was changed

#### Step 4: Emergency Deployment (15 minutes)
1. **Build emergency release** - Use automated build process
2. **Test on clean system** - Verify fix works in deployment environment
3. **Create emergency release** - Tag as `emergency-v1.0.x`
4. **Deploy to user immediately** - Direct delivery to affected user

#### Step 5: Post-Emergency Follow-up (24 hours)
1. **Document full incident** - Complete post-incident report
2. **Review fix quality** - Ensure no technical debt introduced
3. **Plan proper solution** - Design long-term fix if needed
4. **Update procedures** - Improve process based on lessons learned
