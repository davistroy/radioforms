### Form Lifecycle Rules

1. **L-ICS215A-01**: The form is typically prepared by the Safety Officer during the incident action planning cycle
2. **L-ICS215A-02**: The Safety Officer collaborates with the Operations Section Chief during preparation
3. **L-ICS215A-03**: The form is closely linked to the Operational Planning Worksheet (ICS 215)
4. **L-ICS215A-04**: When safety analysis is completed, the form is distributed to the Resources Unit
5. **L-ICS215A-05**: The Resources Unit uses the information to prepare the Operations Section briefing
6. **L-ICS215A-06**: All completed original forms must be given to the Documentation Unit

### Conditional Requirements

1. **C-ICS215A-01**: If multiple operational assignments involve similar hazards, they may be grouped
2. **C-ICS215A-02**: If additional pages are needed, use blank ICS 215A forms and repaginate as needed
3. **C-ICS215A-03**: If specific safety equipment is required, this should be noted in mitigations
4. **C-ICS215A-04**: If particular hazards require specialized briefings, this should be indicated

## 4. User Interface Layout
