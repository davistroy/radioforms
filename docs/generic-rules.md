# AI Coding Rules: Simplicity, Maintainability, and Anti-Complexity Guide
*For Modern Web Development with React, TypeScript, and Tauri*

## Core Philosophy

**The #1 Rule**: If it's not working simply, it won't work complexly.

### Fundamental Principles

1. **Simplicity First**
   - Start with the simplest solution that works
   - Use native/built-in solutions before adding external dependencies
   - Write readable code over clever code
   - Prefer explicit over implicit behavior

2. **Incremental Development**
   - Build one feature completely before starting the next
   - Each feature must have working tests before moving on
   - Deploy to staging after each feature completion
   - Get user feedback before adding complexity

3. **Pragmatic Engineering**
   - Choose boring, stable technology over bleeding edge
   - Build for today's requirements, not tomorrow's possibilities
   - Working code is better than perfect code
   - User feedback trumps developer assumptions

## üö® Critical Anti-Patterns to Avoid

### 1. Premature Optimization
- ‚ùå DON'T implement advanced features (real-time, complex state management, micro-optimizations) before basic CRUD works
- ‚ùå DON'T optimize performance before establishing functionality
- ‚ùå DON'T add complex libraries (virtual scrolling, advanced caching) until proven necessary
- ‚úÖ DO build incrementally: Basic functionality ‚Üí Tests ‚Üí Enhancements ‚Üí Advanced features
- ‚úÖ DO measure before optimizing

### 2. Over-Engineering
- ‚ùå DON'T create complex abstractions for simple problems
- ‚ùå DON'T add dependencies unless absolutely necessary
- ‚ùå DON'T implement features "just in case" or "for the future"
- ‚ùå DON'T create custom hooks for every piece of logic
- ‚ùå DON'T abstract everything into reusable components immediately
- ‚úÖ DO use the simplest solution that works
- ‚úÖ DO refactor only when complexity is proven necessary

### 3. Test Complexity
- ‚ùå DON'T create elaborate mocking systems
- ‚ùå DON'T write integration tests before unit tests work
- ‚ùå DON'T spend more time writing test infrastructure than tests
- ‚úÖ DO write simple, fast tests that actually run (< 30 seconds total)
- ‚úÖ DO mock only external dependencies (database, API calls, file system)

### 4. Dependency Chaos
- ‚ùå DON'T use alpha/beta/RC versions in production code
- ‚ùå DON'T adopt new major versions immediately (wait 3-6 months)
- ‚ùå DON'T add a dependency when native solutions exist
- ‚ùå DON'T add utility libraries (lodash, ramda) without justification
- ‚úÖ DO use stable, well-tested versions
- ‚úÖ DO audit and remove unused dependencies regularly

### 5. React Anti-Patterns
- ‚ùå DON'T create deeply nested component hierarchies
- ‚ùå DON'T pass data through many component layers (prop drilling)
- ‚ùå DON'T create components that do too many things
- ‚ùå DON'T use useEffect for everything
- ‚ùå DON'T create custom hooks for simple state
- ‚úÖ DO keep components focused and simple
- ‚úÖ DO use proper state management (local state > context > global store)

### 6. TypeScript Overuse
- ‚ùå DON'T create overly complex type definitions
- ‚ùå DON'T use advanced TypeScript features unless necessary
- ‚ùå DON'T spend hours making TypeScript happy instead of solving problems
- ‚úÖ DO start with simple types and evolve them
- ‚úÖ DO use `unknown` instead of `any` when you're unsure

## üìã Development Workflow

### Before Starting ANY Feature

**Ask yourself:**
1. [ ] Is the current code stable and tested?
2. [ ] Can this be done with existing dependencies?
3. [ ] Is this feature actually required now?
4. [ ] Have I written tests for existing features?
5. [ ] Can I explain this simply to a non-technical person?

### Implementation Order (ALWAYS Follow This)

1. **Requirements Analysis**
   - Thoroughly understand user needs from their perspective
   - Act as a product manager to identify requirement gaps
   - Prioritize simple solutions that meet actual needs
   - Document what you're building and why

2. **Design & Planning**
   - Create/update README.md with project objectives
   - Document architecture decisions and rationale
   - Plan the simplest possible implementation
   - Identify what can be reused from existing code

3. **Core Implementation**
   - Database schema and data models first
   - Basic CRUD operations with error handling
   - Type definitions and validation
   - Simple, working UI components
   - Wire components to backend

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Unit tests for utilities and core logic
   - Component tests for UI behavior
   - Manual testing of happy paths
   - Tests must run in < 5 seconds individually

5. **Enhancement** (Only After Core Works)
   - Add validation and error handling
   - Implement search and filtering
   - Add permission systems
   - Improve UI/UX based on feedback

6. **Advanced Features** (Only After User Request)
   - Real-time updates
   - Offline functionality
   - Complex state management
   - Performance optimizations

## üõ†Ô∏è Technical Guidelines

### Code Quality Standards

1. **Documentation**
   - Every project needs a comprehensive README.md
   - Document purpose, usage, parameters, and return values
   - Write clear comments for complex logic
   - Keep documentation close to code

2. **Code Organization**
   - Follow established style guides for your language
   - Use consistent naming conventions
   - Keep files between 300-500 lines where possible
   - One responsibility per module/class/function

3. **Error Handling**
   - Implement proper error handling from the start
   - Use appropriate logging levels
   - Fail fast with clear error messages
   - Never silently swallow errors

4. **Testing Strategy**
   - Write tests that actually run and pass
   - Focus on testing behavior, not implementation
   - Keep test setup minimal
   - If test setup is complex, the code is too complex

### Dependency Management Rules

1. **Before Adding ANY Dependency:**
   - Is there a native/built-in solution?
   - Is it well-maintained (check last update, issues, downloads)?
   - Is it compatible with current versions?
   - Have you tested it in isolation first?
   - Can you implement the needed functionality yourself in < 100 lines?

2. **Dependency Health Checks:**
   - Monthly audit of all dependencies
   - Remove unused dependencies immediately
   - Document why each dependency is needed
   - Prefer fewer, well-established packages

### Feature Complexity Guidelines

**Complexity Levels:**
- **Basic (Do First)**: CRUD, forms, lists, authentication, basic UI
- **Intermediate (After Basic Works)**: Search, filters, validation, permissions, API integrations
- **Advanced (After User Feedback)**: Real-time updates, offline mode, AI features, complex visualizations

**Never implement Advanced features until:**
1. All Basic features are complete and tested
2. Intermediate features are stable
3. Users have specifically requested them
4. You have a rollback plan

## üåê Web Development Specific Guidelines

### React Best Practices

1. **Component Design**
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ Good: Simple, focused component
   interface ButtonProps {
     children: React.ReactNode;
     onClick: () => void;
     variant?: 'primary' | 'secondary';
   }
   
   const Button: React.FC<ButtonProps> = ({ children, onClick, variant = 'primary' }) => {
     return (
       <button 
         className={`btn btn-${variant}`}
         onClick={onClick}
       >
         {children}
       </button>
     );
   };
   
   // ‚ùå Bad: Overly complex component
   const SuperButton = ({ children, onClick, variant, size, icon, loading, disabled, tooltip, ...props }) => {
     // 50+ lines of complex logic
   };
   ```

2. **State Management**
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ Good: Start with local state
   const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
   
   // ‚úÖ Good: Use context for related data
   const UserContext = createContext<User | null>(null);
   
   // ‚úÖ Good: Use store for global state
   const useAppStore = create<AppStore>((set) => ({
     theme: 'light',
     setTheme: (theme) => set({ theme }),
   }));
   
   // ‚ùå Bad: Everything in global store
   const useEverythingStore = create(() => ({
     users, posts, comments, notifications, ui, settings, cache, ...
   }));
   ```

3. **Custom Hooks**
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ Good: Simple, reusable logic
   const useLocalStorage = <T>(key: string, defaultValue: T) => {
     const [value, setValue] = useState<T>(() => {
       try {
         const item = localStorage.getItem(key);
         return item ? JSON.parse(item) : defaultValue;
       } catch {
         return defaultValue;
       }
     });
     
     const setStoredValue = (value: T) => {
       setValue(value);
       localStorage.setItem(key, JSON.stringify(value));
     };
     
     return [value, setStoredValue] as const;
   };
   
   // ‚ùå Bad: Complex hook doing too much
   const useEverything = () => {
     // 100+ lines managing multiple concerns
   };
   ```

### TypeScript Best Practices

1. **Type Definitions**
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ Good: Simple, clear types
   interface User {
     id: number;
     name: string;
     email: string;
   }
   
   interface FormData {
     id?: number;
     formType: ICSFormType;
     incidentName: string;
     data: Record<string, unknown>;
   }
   
   // ‚ùå Bad: Overly complex types
   type ComplexType<T extends Record<string, any>, K extends keyof T> = {
     [P in K]: T[P] extends infer U ? U extends string ? `prefix_${U}` : never : never;
   };
   ```

2. **Error Handling**
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ Good: Simple error handling
   const fetchUser = async (id: number): Promise<User | null> => {
     try {
       const response = await api.get(`/users/${id}`);
       return response.data;
     } catch (error) {
       console.error('Failed to fetch user:', error);
       return null;
     }
   };
   
   // ‚ùå Bad: Overly complex error handling
   const fetchUserComplex = async <T extends UserLike>(
     id: number,
     options: FetchOptions<T>
   ): Promise<Result<T, ErrorType[]>> => {
     // Complex error handling logic
   };
   ```

### Styling Best Practices

1. **CSS/Tailwind Usage**
   ```tsx
   // ‚úÖ Good: Simple, semantic classes
   <div className="flex items-center gap-4 p-4 bg-white rounded-lg shadow">
     <button className="px-4 py-2 bg-blue-500 text-white rounded hover:bg-blue-600">
       Save
     </button>
   </div>
   
   // ‚ùå Bad: Overly complex utility classes
   <div className="flex items-center justify-between lg:justify-start xl:justify-center gap-2 sm:gap-4 lg:gap-6 p-2 sm:p-4 lg:p-6 bg-gradient-to-r from-blue-50 via-white to-blue-50 rounded-sm sm:rounded lg:rounded-xl shadow-sm hover:shadow-md transition-all duration-300 ease-in-out">
   ```

2. **Component Styling**
   ```typescript
   // ‚úÖ Good: Use established component library
   import { Button, Card, Input } from '@/components/ui';
   
   // ‚úÖ Good: Simple custom components when needed
   const FormField = ({ label, children, error }) => (
     <div className="space-y-2">
       <label className="text-sm font-medium">{label}</label>
       {children}
       {error && <p className="text-sm text-red-600">{error}</p>}
     </div>
   );
   
   // ‚ùå Bad: Complex styling logic
   const ComplexFormField = ({ variant, size, theme, animation, ... }) => {
     // Complex styling calculations
   };
   ```

## üö© Red Flags & Warning Signs

### You're Over-Engineering If:
- You're writing more infrastructure than features
- Tests take longer to write than the code
- You need a diagram to explain the data flow
- You're adding "just in case" functionality
- The PR/commit has more than 500 lines changed
- You can't demo the feature in 2 minutes
- New developers need more than 30 minutes to understand
- You're using TypeScript features you have to look up
- You're creating abstractions for fewer than 3 use cases

### When Complexity Creeps In:
1. **Stop immediately** - Complexity is a warning sign
2. **List assumptions** - What are you assuming users need?
3. **Simplify ruthlessly** - Can you remove half the code?
4. **Start over** - Sometimes a fresh approach is faster

## üîß Problem-Solving Approach

### When Things Don't Work:
1. **Simplify First**
   - Remove all optional features
   - Comment out complex logic
   - Get the minimal case working
   - Add complexity back incrementally

2. **Debug Systematically**
   - Review error messages carefully
   - Check browser console for errors
   - Use React Developer Tools
   - Isolate the problem area
   - Test assumptions with simple cases

3. **When Stuck:**
   - Can you explain the problem in one sentence?
   - What's the simplest thing that could work?
   - What would you do with unlimited time? Now do 10% of that
   - Is there existing code that solves a similar problem?

## üìä Success Metrics

### Your Code is Successful When:
- New developers understand it in < 30 minutes
- Tests run in < 30 seconds
- Features can be demo'd immediately
- Users actually use what you built
- Bugs are easy to find and fix
- Adding features doesn't break existing ones
- Components can be reused without modification
- TypeScript helps instead of hindering development

### Project Health Indicators:
- ‚úÖ Clear, updated documentation
- ‚úÖ All tests passing
- ‚úÖ No TypeScript errors or warnings
- ‚úÖ Dependencies are current and minimal
- ‚úÖ Code follows consistent patterns
- ‚úÖ Features match user needs (not developer wants)
- ‚úÖ Fast development feedback loops
- ‚úÖ Predictable component behavior

## üéØ Decision Framework

### When Making Technical Decisions:

1. **Choose Boring Technology**
   - Proven solutions over new experiments
   - Well-documented over cutting-edge
   - Community support over unique features
   - React patterns over custom solutions

2. **Minimize Technical Debt**
   - Fix issues immediately, not "later"
   - Refactor when patterns emerge, not preemptively
   - Keep dependencies updated monthly
   - Remove unused code and dependencies

3. **Maximize Maintainability**
   - Code for the next developer (it might be you)
   - Prefer clarity over performance (until measured)
   - Document why, not just what
   - Use TypeScript to catch errors, not to show off

## üí° Best Practices Summary

### Always:
- ‚úÖ Build features incrementally
- ‚úÖ Test as you go
- ‚úÖ Get user feedback early
- ‚úÖ Keep it simple
- ‚úÖ Document decisions
- ‚úÖ Remove unused code/dependencies
- ‚úÖ Use TypeScript for safety, not complexity
- ‚úÖ Prefer composition over inheritance
- ‚úÖ Write code that reads like prose

### Never:
- ‚ùå Add features users haven't asked for
- ‚ùå Use unstable dependencies
- ‚ùå Write placeholder/stubbed code
- ‚ùå Duplicate code instead of refactoring
- ‚ùå Sacrifice clarity for cleverness
- ‚ùå Skip testing to "save time"
- ‚ùå Create abstractions for single use cases
- ‚ùå Ignore TypeScript errors
- ‚ùå Use complex state management for simple problems

## üèÅ Final Checklist

Before considering any feature "done":
- [ ] Does it solve the user's actual problem?
- [ ] Can you demo it in 2 minutes?
- [ ] Are all tests passing?
- [ ] Is the code self-documenting?
- [ ] Have you removed all unused code?
- [ ] Would a new developer understand it?
- [ ] Is it the simplest solution that works?
- [ ] Does TypeScript help or hinder?
- [ ] Can components be reused easily?
- [ ] Is the state management appropriate for the complexity?

## üåê Web-Specific Reminders

### React Development:
- Start with function components and hooks
- Use local state first, then context, then global store
- Keep components small and focused
- Test user interactions, not implementation details
- Use semantic HTML elements
- Implement proper loading and error states

### TypeScript Development:
- Start with simple types and evolve them
- Use strict mode and fix all errors
- Prefer interfaces over types for object shapes
- Use union types for known possibilities
- Don't fight TypeScript - if it's hard, simplify

### Performance:
- Don't optimize until you measure
- Use React.memo only when proven necessary
- Lazy load routes and large components
- Virtualize lists only when they're large (>100 items)
- Use React Developer Tools Profiler

## Remember

> "Perfection is achieved not when there is nothing more to add, but when there is nothing left to take away." - Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry

**Focus on:**
- User value over technical elegance
- Simplicity over sophistication
- Today's problems over tomorrow's possibilities
- Maintenance over features
- Clarity over cleverness
- Working software over perfect architecture

**The goal is not to build the most technically impressive solution, but to solve real problems with the least complexity possible.**
