# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# ICS Forms Management Application

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** May 31, 2025  
**Status:** Draft

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for a standalone, offline-first desktop application that enables users to create, manage, export, and archive FEMA Incident Command System (ICS) forms. The application will provide administrative staff and radio operators with a modern, intuitive web-based interface for managing ICS forms while supporting offline operation and multiple export formats.

### 1.2 Document Conventions
* "User" refers to administrative staff or radio operators using the application
* "Must" indicates a required feature
* "Should" indicates a recommended feature
* "May" indicates an optional feature

### 1.3 Intended Audience
* Development team responsible for implementing the application
* QA team responsible for testing the application
* Project stakeholders who need to understand the application's functionality

### 1.4 Project Scope
The application will be a **STANDALONE, PORTABLE** cross-platform desktop application that consists of a single executable file and a single data file. It stores form data in a SQLite database and allows a single user to create, manage, and export FEMA ICS forms in various formats. The application runs completely offline without internet connection and can be deployed by simply copying two files. **Key Design Principles**: Maximum simplicity, zero installation required, portable operation (runs from flash drive), intuitive single-user interface requiring no training, and fully documented code with zero technical debt.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The ICS Forms Management Application is a new, standalone system designed to replace the current process of using individual PDF forms stored locally on hard drives. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing ICS forms in an offline environment, with the ability to export forms in various formats including JSON, PDF, and radio-transmissible text. The application follows a modern web-based architecture with native desktop integration to improve usability while maintaining offline-first functionality.

### 2.2 User Classes and Characteristics
* **Single User Operation**: The application is designed for individual use by one person at a time. Users include administrative staff and radio operators who need to create and manage ICS forms without technical expertise. The interface must be intuitive enough that any emergency management professional can use it immediately without training.

### 2.3 Operating Environment
* **Portable Operation**: Single executable file that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
* **Flash Drive Compatible**: Application and data can run from any storage location
* **No Installation Required**: Zero-dependency deployment - just copy and run
* **Minimum Requirements**: 1280x720 screen resolution, 4GB RAM
* **Self-Contained**: No internet connection required, no external dependencies
* **Simple Deployment**: Application = 1 executable file + 1 database file
* **Modern Interface**: Embedded web engine (WebView2/WebKit) for contemporary UI

### 2.4 Design and Implementation Constraints
* Must operate completely offline without internet connectivity
* Must provide data export capabilities in multiple formats
* Must maintain form data integrity and implement audit trails
* Must support keyboard navigation and accessibility standards
* Must provide responsive design for various screen sizes
* Must maintain compatibility with existing ICS form standards

### 2.5 User Documentation
* Built-in help system accessible via F1 key
* Contextual tooltips for form fields and validation rules
* Quick reference guides for keyboard shortcuts
* User manual covering all application features

### 2.6 Assumptions and Dependencies
* Users have basic computer literacy
* Target deployment environments support modern desktop applications
* Forms will be primarily completed by single users (limited concurrent editing requirements)
* Export formats will be consumed by external systems or transmitted via radio

#### 3.1.4 Form Lifecycle Workflows

**Draft Creation Workflow:**
1. User selects "New Form" from main interface
2. User selects form type from ICS form type dropdown
3. System creates new form instance with incident information template
4. User fills in required identification fields (incident name, operational period)
5. System auto-saves as draft every 30 seconds
6. User can save manually and continue later

**Form Completion Workflow:**
1. User opens draft form from forms list
2. User completes all required fields per form type validation rules
3. System validates form data in real-time with field-level error messages
4. User clicks "Mark Complete" - system runs final validation
5. If validation passes, form status changes to "Completed"
6. If validation fails, user must resolve errors before completion

**Form Completion and Archival Workflow:**
1. User reviews completed form for accuracy
2. User can add notes or comments to form metadata
3. User marks form as "Final" when satisfied with content
4. Final forms become read-only and are available for archival

**Form Archival Workflow:**
1. Incident closure triggers bulk archival option
2. User selects forms for archival from completed forms list
3. System creates timestamped archive export (JSON + PDF)
4. Forms marked as "Archived" remain searchable but read-only
5. Archive exports stored in user-designated backup location
