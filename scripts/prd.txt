# Product Requirements Document (PRD)
# ICS Forms Management Application

**Version:** 2.0  
**Date:** May 31, 2025  
**Status:** Production-Ready Foundation Complete

## 1. Introduction

### 1.1 Purpose
This document defines the requirements for a standalone, offline-first desktop application that enables users to create, manage, export, and archive FEMA Incident Command System (ICS) forms. The application provides administrative staff and radio operators with a modern, intuitive web-based interface for managing ICS forms while supporting offline operation and multiple export formats.

### 1.2 Project Scope
The application is a **STANDALONE, PORTABLE** cross-platform desktop application that consists of a single executable file and a single data file. It stores form data in a SQLite database and allows a single user to create, manage, and export FEMA ICS forms in various formats. The application runs completely offline without internet connection and can be deployed by simply copying two files.

**Key Design Principles**: Maximum simplicity, zero installation required, portable operation (runs from flash drive), intuitive single-user interface requiring no training, and fully documented code with zero technical debt.

## 2. Overall Description

### 2.1 Product Perspective
The ICS Forms Management Application is a new, standalone system designed to replace the current process of using individual PDF forms stored locally on hard drives. It provides a comprehensive solution for managing ICS forms in an offline environment, with the ability to export forms in various formats including JSON, PDF, and radio-transmissible text.

### 2.2 Operating Environment
* **Portable Operation**: Single executable file that runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux
* **Flash Drive Compatible**: Application and data can run from any storage location
* **No Installation Required**: Zero-dependency deployment - just copy and run
* **Minimum Requirements**: 1280x720 screen resolution, 4GB RAM
* **Self-Contained**: No internet connection required, no external dependencies
* **Simple Deployment**: Application = 1 executable file + 1 database file

### 2.3 Current Status: Production-Ready Foundation
The application now has a solid, zero-debt foundation with:
- ✅ **Real Rust backend** with SQLite database (SQLx 0.8+)
- ✅ **Modern React frontend** with TypeScript 5.8+ and Enterprise UI
- ✅ **Zero security vulnerabilities** and latest dependencies
- ✅ **Production build working** - generates optimized single executable
- ✅ **Comprehensive testing foundation** ready for feature development
- ✅ **Enterprise-grade UI system** with accessibility and performance standards

**Ready for Phase 2: Core Functionality Development**
